## twoSum

Files provided in this directory contain solutions for basic twoSum problem, implemented in Go.
- main.go file contains solution using two-pionter approach with prior sorting of the input array by quicksort. Time complexity estimated as O(NlogN)
- alternative.go file contains solution based purely on hashmap. Time complexity - O(N)
